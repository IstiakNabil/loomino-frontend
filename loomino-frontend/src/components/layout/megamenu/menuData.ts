/**
 * Nav mega-menu content — ONLY links backed by real backend
 * functionality. Merchandising-only labels from the Figma
 * design (Bundles, Occasion Wear, Matching Set, Suiting) are
 * intentionally omitted until a Collection concept exists on
 * the backend, to avoid fake filters.
 *
 * Each menu's `tiles` are the small photo previews shown on
 * the right of the panel. Their images come from CMS > Site
 * Banners (see `bannerKey`), so an admin can swap them without
 * touching code — but the label + destination stay hardcoded
 * here so every tile always points somewhere real.
 *
 * Sustainability's links deep-link into real sections of
 * SustainabilityPage.tsx via anchor ids (#mission, #processing,
 * etc.) — not fabricated destinations.
 *
 * Supported backend filters on /shop:
 *   - is_new_arrival=true        (New In)
 *   - is_featured=true           (Featured)
 *   - category=<slug>            (real categories, loaded live)
